### Courses Brochures
Here are five brochures with a listing of courses, interest groups and volunteering opportunities available at over 100 Community Clubs island-wide, as well as at PAssion WaVe outlets.

For convenience, the programmes are categorised by residential district, and we welcome everyone to join our MGs!

Download the brochures now to get information on the available programmes and read about the experiences shared by our PA Merdeka Generation ambassadors.
